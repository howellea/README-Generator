# README-GENERATOR

Create a dynamic and professional README.md file using CLI prompts powered by Inquirer.

## Description

This project is a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional `README.md` file based on user input using the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer).

- **Motivation**: To simplify the process of creating high-quality README files for projects.  
- **Reason**: A well-crafted README is essential for explaining what an application does, how to install and use it, and how to contribute or report issues, thereby increasing the project's success.  
- **Problem Solved**: Helps developers quickly generate a comprehensive README file without spending unnecessary time formatting it manually.  
- **What I Learned**: Gained experience with the Inquirer npm package, a powerful tool for creating command-line applications in Node.js.
